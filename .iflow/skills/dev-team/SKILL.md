## State Management

The skill maintains persistent state in `.state/` directory at the **project root**:

- **project-spec.md**: Requirements, scope, deliverables
- **sprint-planner.md**: Tasks, assignments, progress
- **team-composition.md**: Agent assignments and capacity
- **decisions-log.md**: Architectural and technical decisions
- **quality-metrics.md**: Test coverage, defect density, performance
- **handover.md**: Session continuity information

**Important**: State files are ALWAYS maintained at the project root (`PROJECT_ROOT/.state/`), NOT in the skill directory. The `.iflow/skills/dev-team/.state/` directory serves only as a template.

**Auto-Update Behavior**: The dev-team skill automatically updates all state files in `.state/` at the project root during:
- Requirements analysis phase → Updates `project-spec.md`
- Sprint planning phase → Updates `sprint-planner.md`
- Development cycle → Updates `team-composition.md` and `decisions-log.md`
- Quality assurance → Updates `quality-metrics.md`
- Completion/handoff → Updates `handover.md`

**State Location**: Always `PROJECT_ROOT/.state/` (e.g., `/Users/inu/_dev/github/navier_stokes/.state/`)

## Agent Dispatcher

The skill includes an intelligent agent dispatcher that:

1. **Task Type Detection**:
   - Frontend tasks → Frontend Developer agent
   - Backend tasks → Backend Developer agent
   - Test tasks → QA Engineer agent
   - Architecture decisions → Tech Lead agent
   - Infrastructure tasks → DevOps Engineer agent
   - Progress tracking → Project Manager agent

2. **Automatic Skill Integration**:
   - Development tasks → Auto-enforce TDD workflow
   - All commits → Auto-use git-manage format
   - Quality gates → Auto-run QA validation
   - Coverage checks → Auto-enforce thresholds

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Parse task dependencies
   - Execute tasks in correct order
   - Parallelize independent tasks
   - Handle blockers automatically

## Quality Gates (Auto-Enforced)

Before each commit, automatically:

1. ✅ Run test suite
2. ✅ Check coverage ≥80% lines, ≥70% branches (configurable)
3. ✅ Validate TDD compliance
4. ✅ Check code complexity (Simplicity First principle)
5. ✅ Verify surgical changes (no unrelated modifications)
6. ✅ Check for hardcoded values (No Hardcoding principle)
7. ✅ Security vulnerability scan
8. ✅ Accessibility compliance check

If any gate fails:
- Block commit
- Return task to in_progress
- Provide remediation guidance
- Retry after fixes

## Development Principles (Karpathy Guidelines)

The dev-team skill enforces four core principles to prevent common LLM coding pitfalls and ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

### Think Before Coding

**Problem Addressed**: Wrong assumptions, hidden confusion, missing tradeoffs

**Enforcement by Tech Lead during Planning Phase:**

- **State assumptions explicitly** — If uncertain, ask rather than guess
- **Present multiple interpretations** — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists
- **Push back when warranted** — If a simpler approach exists, say so
- **Stop when confused** — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification

**Integration with Sprint Planning:**
- Each task must include explicit assumptions and clarifications
- Tradeoffs must be documented before implementation
- Ambiguous requirements trigger clarification loops with user

### Simplicity First

**Problem Addressed**: Overcomplication, bloated abstractions

**Enforcement by Tech Lead during Code Review:**

- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
- No error handling for impossible scenarios
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it

**The test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

**Automatic Enforcement (during TDD cycle):**

Complexity checks with configurable thresholds (from `config/quality-gates.json`):
- **Function length**: ≤50 lines (break down larger functions)
- **File length**: ≤300 lines (split into smaller modules)
- **Nesting depth**: ≤4 (flatten with early returns/guard clauses)
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: ≤10 (simplify logic, extract methods)
- **Cognitive complexity**: ≤15 (reduce mental effort to understand)

Clean code validation:
- **DRY principle**: No duplicated code blocks >3 lines
- **Single responsibility**: Functions do one thing only
- **Descriptive naming**: No abbreviations, meaningful names
- **No magic numbers**: Extract to named constants

Over-engineering detection:
- Abstractions for single-use code
- "Flexible" patterns without requirements
- Unnecessary error handling for impossible scenarios
- Configurability that wasn't requested

**Integration with Quality Gates:**
- Code complexity metrics enforced in pre-commit checks
- Clean code validation after REFACTOR phase
- Refactor tasks required if complexity exceeds thresholds
- Block commits if clean code violations detected
- Simplicity criteria evaluated automatically at each phase

**Examples of violations:**
- ❌ Function with 75 lines (max: 50) → Split into 3 smaller functions
- ❌ Nesting depth 6 (max: 4) → Use early returns or extract to helper
- ❌ Cyclomatic complexity 15 (max: 10) → Extract complex logic
- ❌ Same 5-line code block in 3 places → Extract to function
- ❌ Function called `proc` → Rename to `processPayment`
- ❌ Magic number `3000` → `const MAX_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 3000`

### Surgical Changes

**Problem Addressed**: Orthogonal edits, touching code you shouldn't

**Enforcement by QA Engineer during Code Review:**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it

**When your changes create orphans:**
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

**Integration with git-manage:**
- Diff analysis before commit to verify surgical changes
- Block commits with unrelated modifications
- Require justification for any changes beyond scope

### Goal-Driven Execution

**Problem Addressed**: Leverage through tests-first, verifiable success criteria

**Enforcement by Agent Dispatcher during Task Assignment:**

Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals:

| Instead of... | Transform to... |
|---|---|
| "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make them pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Ensure tests pass before and after" |

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

**Integration with TDD Workflow:**
- Every task must have explicit success criteria before execution
- Tests written first (TDD) define success criteria
- Agent loops independently until criteria verified
- Weak criteria ("make it work") rejected during task assignment

### No Recursive Algorithms and Infinite Loops

**Problem Addressed**: Stack overflow risks, unpredictable performance, difficult debugging, resource exhaustion

**Enforcement by Tech Lead during Code Review:**

- **Reject all recursive implementations** — Use iterative solutions instead
- **Require explicit loop termination** — All loops must have clear exit conditions
- **Verify bounded iteration** — No infinite loops (while true, for (;;))
- **Check for recursion patterns** — Self-referential function calls are prohibited
- **Validate loop safety** — Ensure loops have maximum iteration limits or timeouts

**Quality Gate Enforcement:**
Before each commit, automatically scan for:
- Recursive function calls (function calling itself directly or indirectly)
- Infinite loop patterns (`while(true)`, `while(1)`, `for(;;)`)
- Unbounded loops without explicit termination conditions
- Mutual recursion between functions
- Tail recursion (still prohibited - use iteration)

**Examples of what NOT to do:**
```typescript
// ❌ Recursive function - stack overflow risk
function factorial(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 1) return 1
  return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

// ❌ Recursive tree traversal
function traverse(node: Node) {
  console.log(node.value)
  if (node.left) traverse(node.left)
  if (node.right) traverse(node.right)
}

// ❌ Infinite loop - never terminates
while (true) {
  processMessages()
}

// ❌ Infinite loop - unbounded
for (;;) {
  waitForEvent()
}

// ❌ Mutual recursion
function isEven(n: number): boolean {
  if (n === 0) return true
  return isOdd(n - 1)
}

function isOdd(n: number): boolean {
  if (n === 0) return false
  return isEven(n - 1)
}

// ❌ Unbounded while loop
while (!isDone()) {
  processItem(items.pop())
}
```

**Examples of what TO do:**
```typescript
// ✅ Iterative factorial
function factorial(n: number): number {
  let result = 1
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i
  }
  return result
}

// ✅ Iterative tree traversal
function traverse(root: Node) {
  const stack: Node[] = [root]
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const node = stack.pop()
    console.log(node.value)
    if (node.right) stack.push(node.right)
    if (node.left) stack.push(node.left)
  }
}

// ✅ Bounded loop with timeout
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000
const startTime = Date.now()
const TIMEOUT_MS = 5000

while (!isDone() && iterationCount < MAX_ITERATIONS && (Date.now() - startTime) < TIMEOUT_MS) {
  processItem(items.pop())
  iterationCount++
}

// ✅ Explicit condition
while (hasMoreMessages()) {
  const message = getNextMessage()
  if (!message) break
  processMessage(message)
}

// ✅ Iterative solution for mutual recursion
function isEven(n: number): boolean {
  return n % 2 === 0
}

function isOdd(n: number): boolean {
  return n % 2 !== 0
}

// ✅ Queue-based processing
function processQueue(queue: QueueItem[]) {
  for (const item of queue) {
    if (item.shouldProcess) {
      processItem(item)
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration with Code Review:**
- AST analysis to detect recursive function calls
- Pattern matching for infinite loop constructs
- Control flow analysis to verify loop termination
- Block commits containing recursive implementations
- Flag infinite loops as critical violations

**Integration with Quality Gates:**
- Pre-commit validation scans for recursion patterns
- Block commits with unbounded loops
- Require maximum iteration limits for all loops
- Validate all while/for loops have explicit conditions

### No Hardcoding

**Problem Addressed**: Magic numbers, embedded configuration values, hardcoded thresholds that make code difficult to maintain and adapt

**Enforcement by All Agents during Implementation and Code Review:**

- **Externalize all configuration** — No magic numbers, thresholds, or constant values in implementation code
- **Use configuration files** — All project settings, limits, and constants must be in config files (e.g., `config/*.json`, `.env`, `constants.ts`)
- **Read from environment** — Use environment variables for deployment-specific values
- **Define constants explicitly** — If a value must be in code, it must be a named constant at the top of the file with clear documentation
- **Dynamic over static** — Prefer data-driven approaches (read from files/databases) over hardcoded logic

**Quality Gate Enforcement:**
Before each commit, automatically scan for:
- Numeric literals that aren't defined constants
- String literals used as configuration values
- Threshold values embedded in conditionals
- URLs, API endpoints, or service addresses
- File paths outside the project directory
- Magic numbers without context (comments not sufficient)

**Examples of what NOT to do:**
```typescript
// ❌ Hardcoded threshold
if (coverage.lines < 80) throw new Error('Coverage too low')

// ❌ Magic number
const timeout = 30000 // 30 seconds - what does this mean?

// ❌ Hardcoded tech stack
const techStack = { framework: 'React', language: 'TypeScript' }

// ❌ Hardcoded API endpoint
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com/v1'

// ❌ Hardcoded file path
const logFile = '/var/log/app.log'

// ❌ Magic number in loop
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) { /* what is 100? */ }
```

**Examples of what TO do:**
```typescript
// ✅ Read from config
const config = loadConfig('quality-gates.json')
if (coverage.lines < config.coverage.lines) throw new Error(config.errors.coverageTooLow)

// ✅ Named constant with documentation
const API_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000 // 30 seconds: maximum wait time for external API responses

// ✅ Data-driven
const techStack = recommendTechStack(projectType, features, constraints)

// ✅ Environment variable
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL || 'https://api.example.com/v1'

// ✅ Project-relative path
const logFile = path.join(process.cwd(), 'logs', 'app.log')

// ✅ Named constant
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 100
for (let i = 0; i < MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS; i++) { /* ... */ }
```

**Integration with Project Initialization:**
- Auto-generate configuration files during project setup
- Document all configuration options and their purposes
- Provide validation schemas for configuration files
- Create `.env.example` template for environment variables

**Integration with Code Review:**
- Scan for magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Verify all thresholds come from configuration
- Check for embedded constants that should be externalized
- Validate file paths are project-relative
- Block commits with hardcoded values detected

**Principle Enforcement Summary:**

| Principle | Enforced By | When |
|---|---|---|
| Think Before Coding | Tech Lead | Planning Phase |
| Simplicity First | Tech Lead | Code Review |
| Surgical Changes | QA Engineer | Code Review |
| Goal-Driven Execution | Agent Dispatcher | Task Assignment |
| No Hardcoding | All Agents | Implementation + Code Review |
| No Recursive Algorithms | Tech Lead + Quality Gates | Code Review + Pre-commit |

These principles bias toward **caution over speed**. For trivial tasks (simple typo fixes, obvious one-liners), agents use judgment — not every change needs the full rigor.

## File Operations Restriction

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: All file operations MUST be restricted to the current project directory.

**Allowed Paths:**
- Any path under the current working directory (project root)
- Examples: `./src/`, `./tests/`, `./config/`, relative paths within project

**Forbidden Paths:**
- `/tmp/` - Temporary directory (use project temp dir instead)
- `/var/` - System variable directory
- System directories outside project root
- Absolute paths outside the current working directory
- Home directory paths outside project
- User configuration directories outside project

**Enforcement by All Agents:**

Before any `write_file` or `replace` operation, every agent MUST:

1. **Validate the file path**:
   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for path validation
   import os
   project_root = os.getcwd()
   abs_path = os.path.abspath(file_path)

   if not abs_path.startswith(project_root):
       raise PermissionError(
           f"File operations restricted to project directory. "
           f"Attempted: {abs_path}, Project root: {project_root}"
       )
   ```

2. **Check for forbidden patterns**:
   - Reject any path starting with `/tmp/`
   - Reject any path starting with `/var/`
   - Reject any path starting with `/home/` (unless within project)
   - Reject any path starting with `/Users/` (unless within project)
   - Reject any absolute path outside project root

3. **Block and report violations**:
   - Stop the operation immediately
   - Report the violation with clear error message
   - Suggest using project directory instead
   - Log the attempted operation for audit

4. **Quality Gate Validation**:
   - Pre-commit validation ensures no files outside project directory were modified
   - Block commits if forbidden paths are detected in changes
   - Scan git diff for absolute paths outside project root

**Examples:**

✅ **Allowed:**
- `./src/components/Button.tsx`
- `tests/integration/test_api.py`
- `/Users/inu/project/src/app.tsx` (within project root)
- `/path/to/project/config/settings.json` (within project root)

❌ **Forbidden:**
- `/tmp/test_file.txt`
- `/var/log/app.log`
- `/home/user/somefile.txt` (outside project)
- `/Users/inu/somefile.txt` (outside project)
- `~/.bashrc` (user config)
- `/etc/hosts` (system config)

## Progress Tracking

The skill automatically updates:

- **Real-time progress**: Task completion status
- **Quality metrics**: Coverage, test results, defect count
- **Velocity tracking**: Tasks completed per sprint
- **Blocker management**: Automatic escalation of blockers

## Integration with Other Skills

- **tdd-enforce**: Automatically enforced for all development (supports Goal-Driven Execution)
- **git-manage**: Automatically used for all commits (enforces Surgical Changes principle)
- **frontend-tester**: Automatically invoked after frontend changes
- **Karpathy Guidelines**: Integrated into dev-team workflow (Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution)

## Completion Detection

Project is considered complete when:

1. ✅ All todos marked "completed"
2. ✅ All quality gates passed
3. ✅ Final QA validation successful
4. ✅ Build successful
5. ✅ Deployment successful
6. ✅ Smoke tests passing

Then automatically:
- Generate delivery report
- Update quality-metrics.md
- Create handoff documentation
- Notify user project is ready
