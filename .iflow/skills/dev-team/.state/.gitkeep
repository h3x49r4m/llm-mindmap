# Dev-Team State Directory

This directory serves as a template for dev-team state files.

The actual project state is located at: `.state/` (project root)

## Template Structure

When dev-team skill is activated, it should:
1. Copy template files from `.iflow/skills/dev-team/.state/` to `.state/`
2. Initialize project-specific state in `.state/`
3. Track changes in `.state/` (not in this template directory)

## State Files

- `project-spec.md` - Project requirements and deliverables
- `quality-metrics.md` - Quality metrics and tracking
- `decisions-log.md` - Architectural and technical decisions
- `handover.md` - Session handover information
- `sprint-planner.md` - Sprint tasks and progress
- `team-composition.md` - Team roles and responsibilities

## Purpose

This template ensures consistent state file structure across projects while allowing each project to maintain its own state at the root level.
